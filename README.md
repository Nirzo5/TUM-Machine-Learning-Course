# TUM-Machine-Learning-Course
Python implementations of core ML techniques (regression, classification, clustering, PCA, etc.) from my TUM exchange course.
This repository contains my hands-on projects and implementations from the Machine Learning course I took during my exchange semester at Technical University of Munich (TUM).

The course combined theoretical foundations with practical coding exercises using Python and its core data science libraries. Topics covered include both supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as dimensionality reduction and optimization techniques.

Topics Covered
1 Linear & Logistic Regression
2 Decision Trees & Random Forests
3 Naive Bayes & K-Nearest Neighbors
4 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5 Evaluation Metrics (MSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.)
6 K-Means Clustering & PCA
7 Gradient Descent Variants (SGD, SGA, Mini-Batch)
8 Autoencoders for anomaly detection
9 Python tools: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
